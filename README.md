# efmviz
A MATLAB-based integrative workflow for graphically visualizing EFMs in a semi-automated way. The workflow offers a platform for comprehensive EFM analysis, starting with EFM generation followed by visualization and data mapping. This flexible workflow seamlessly integrates the existing toolboxes COBRA (COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox) or RAVEN (Reconstruction, Analysis and Visualization of Metabolic Networks)with Cytoscape, an open-source network visualization tool. The applicability of the workflow is demonstrated using two use cases with two genome-scale models, (1) iAF1260 (E. coli) and (2) Recon 2.2 (human). Currently, the workflow using COBRA toolbox is available here.

Start with the 'init_\<useCase\>.m'. These scripts create the 'efmviz/results/\<useCase\>' folder along with all the files generated by each step of the workflow and are named accordingly. All the results from this workflow are present in 'efmviz/results/\<useCase\>_efmviz'.
